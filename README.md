# some covid modelling

## data

Data source is [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/).

I use [Flat Data](https://next.github.com/projects/flat-data) to bring down updated data each day. I'm only bringing down a little bit!

## models

I'm not doing anything sophisticated atm, stats maybe.

calculang bundles may be unnecessarily large without pruning data.

## todo

I should probably be applying [Arquero](https://uwdata.github.io/arquero/) at least somewhere.

I should be pruning, but ideally not manually.
